Samza REST supports the ability to add Monitors to the service. The initial implementation is very basic. Monitors are essentially tasks that can be scheduled to run periodically. They do not read the config and they are all scheduled at the same global interval. More capabilities will be added later, but the initial implementation supports simple cases like monitoring the YARN NodeManager and restarting it if it dies.

## Implementing a New Monitor
Implement the [Monitor](../api/javadocs/org/apache/samza/monitor/Monitor.html) interface with some behavior that should be executed periodically. This could be some java code that invokes some method on the SAMZA Rest Service, or a bash script to restart a failed NodeManager, for example.

## Adding a New Monitor to the Samza REST Service
Add the fully-qualified class name of the Monitor implementation to the `monitor.classes` property in the service config.

Set the `monitor.run.interval.ms` property to the appropriate interval. The `monitor()` method will be invoked at this interval.

For more information on these properties, see the config table in the [Overview page.](overview.html)
